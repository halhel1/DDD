# Team-5
## Deep Dive Descent
-Endless procedurally generated rougelike following a deep sea diver traversing the deepest and darkest depths of the ocean

-You can move with the arrow keys or w,a,s,d. Dash with space bar and attack with left click.

-Defeat all enemies in a level to open the path to the next.

## How to run
-You will have to download the Godot Engine. For Windows do it through this link: https://godotengine.org/download/windows/

-Make sure you download the version with C# support

-Clone the repo or download the zip file

-Once downloaded, open Godot and press import. Navigate to the folder with the project.godot file in it

-You should now be able to develop inside of the godot engine. (Assuming you don't change anything, pressing Run Project, or F5, should be sufficient to run the project from here)

-If this doesn't work for whatever reason, navigate to the main menu scene in "res://Scenes/Menu/MainMenu" and run this scene.
